Simulation = 100
Batch size = 16
Added layers = Batch Optimisation
Objective = Test batch optimisation as the only added layer
Results = Really good smooth training accuracy curve, no change in validation curve, fairly good training loss curve, validation loss curve increasing as opposed to decreasing
